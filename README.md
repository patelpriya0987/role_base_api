# Role-Based API

This project is a backend application implementing role-based authentication and authorization. It provides structured APIs for user and role management, ensuring secure and controlled access to resources.

## Features

- **Role-Based Authentication**: Secure user authentication with role differentiation (e.g., Admin, User).
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Access control based on assigned roles and permissions.
- **User Management**: Create, read, update, and delete user profiles.
- **Role Management**: Define and manage roles with specific permissions.
- **Middleware**: Custom middleware for authentication and authorization.
- **Scalable Design**: Modular architecture for easy maintenance and scalability.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose for schema modeling
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication
- **Middleware**: Custom middleware for access control
- **Other Tools**: Postman for API testing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/role_base_api-main.git
   cd role_base_api-main
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure the environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following variables:
     ```
     PORT=3000
     MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
     ```

4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- **POST /auth/register**: Register a new user
- **POST /auth/login**: Authenticate and retrieve a JWT token

### Users
- **GET /users**: Get a list of all users (Admin only)
- **GET /users/:id**: Get user details by ID
- **PUT /users/:id**: Update user information
- **DELETE /users/:id**: Delete a user (Admin only)

### Roles
- **GET /roles**: Get a list of roles
- **POST /roles**: Create a new role
- **PUT /roles/:id**: Update a role
- **DELETE /roles/:id**: Delete a role

## Usage

1. Register users and assign roles.
2. Authenticate using the login endpoint to get a JWT token.
3. Use the token to access protected routes based on role permissions.
